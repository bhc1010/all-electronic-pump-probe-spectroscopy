# All-Electronic Pump-Probe Spectroscopy
A python solution for preforming all-electronic pump-probe spectroscopy via scanning tunneling microscope.
Logic for preforming experiments is contained in src/pumpProbe.py and devices.py. UI code is contained in the files src/app.py, src/extend_qt.py, and src/run.py.

UI code will soon be moved to a stand-alone repo and ppspectroscopy will be made into a python package.
***This is a work-in-progress***
